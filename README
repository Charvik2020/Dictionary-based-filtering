Abstract:
	Digital image processing refers to the process of
digital images by means of digital computer. The main application
area in digital image processing is to enhance the pictorial data
for human interpretation. In image some of the unwanted information
is present that will be removed by several preprocessing
techniques. Filtering helps to enhance the image by removing
noise.Initially By creating Dictionary we will store two form of
matrix.now when We add new image in dictionary we don’t need
to pass image from filter instead we will just Dictionary Learn
form the Previous Dictionary and just map into.

Introduction:
	Basically the idea of Dictionary based filtering is instead
of doing classical convolution every time,we directly take
de–noise image from the dictionary using searching algorithm
and time after time Learning of dictionary is also done by
the same algorithm. We are planning to do low pass or high
pass filtering to de–noise the noisy image. Low pass filter is
used to remove salt and paper noise while high pass filter is
used to separate of edges.We use OpenCV libraries and Python
libraries to implement the low pass filter and to create blocks
of image.
Initially we take some training and filter them by using
classical convolution.Both filtered and non-filtered images are
divided into blocks which are stored in a dictionary.In the
dictionary the key is noisy part of the image and the value is
filtered part of the image.
